Each dish is dizzingly complex in flavour profile - as Indian cuisine is famous for - but none are overdone or exorbitant in price. You will find your favourite staples like naan and butter chicken, but if there's one Indian restaurant where you should push your menu boundaries, it's at Kinara. Try the Jhinga Biryani, with plump tender prawns and al-dente spiced rice or the Lucknowi Burra Kebab, with tender morsels of lamb. Heat-level can be tailored to your liking, but with truly great Indian food, the beauty is in the interplay of spices rather than the blunt spiciness.",
